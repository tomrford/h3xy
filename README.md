# H3xy

H3xy is a Vector HexView drop in replacement (cli behaviour only) with a few enhancements, including a library API to reuse the same operations on in-memory data blocks, additional features (multi-crc) and the ability to work cross-platform.

This was built with a Ralph loop running tests against the original binary via WSL.
